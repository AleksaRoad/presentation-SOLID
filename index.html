            The SOLID principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin in his 2000 paper “Design
            Principles and Design Patterns.” These concepts were later built upon by Michael
            Feathers, who introduced us to the SOLID acronym. And in the last 20 years, these five
            principles have revolutionized the world of object-oriented programming, changing the
            way that we write software.

            A class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have
            only one primary responsibility.

            Pros are
            - Improved maintainability
            - Better separation of concerns

            Cons of the principle:

            Now let's talk about the second principle.
            Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for
            modification. Your code so that you will be able to add new functionality without changing the existing
            code.
            That prevents situations
            in which a change to one of your classes also requires you to adapt all depending classes.

            The Liskov substitution principle (LSP) is a particular definition of a subtyping relation, called strong
            behavioral subtyping, that was initially introduced by Barbara Liskov in a 1987 conference keynote address
            titled Data
            abstraction and hierarchy. It is based on the concept of "substitutability" - a principle in object-oriented
            programming
            stating that an object (such as a class) may be replaced by a sub-object (such as a class that extends the
            first
            class) without breaking the program. It is a semantic rather than merely syntactic relation, because it
            intends to
            guarantee semantic interoperability of types in a hierarchy, object types in particular.

            The Interface Segregation Principle states that a client should never be forced to implement an interface that it does
            not use, or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
            The objective behind this principle is to remove unnecessary
            code from Classes in order to reduce unexpected bugs when the Class does not have the ability to perform an action. We
            split actions into smaller sets so a Class only executes the actions it requires.
                        Pros:
                        - Cleaner interfaces: Clients only need to implement the specific methods they use, leading to cleaner and
                        more focused
                        interfaces.
                        - Avoids interface pollution: Prevents the introduction of unnecessary methods in classes that do not use
                        them.

                        Cons:
                        - More effort in interface design: Implementing multiple smaller interfaces may require more effort in
                        designing and
                        maintaining the codebase.

            High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not
            depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
            Pros:
            - Decoupling: High-level modules and low-level modules become decoupled from each other, allowing for easier maintenance
            and modification.
            - Flexibility: Dependency inversion allows for easier swapping of dependencies, promoting modularity and flexibility in
            the codebase.

            Cons:
            - Initial complexity: Implementing dependency inversion may require more upfront design and setup, which can increase
            the complexity of the codebase.
            - Indirectness: Introducing abstractions can sometimes make the code less straightforward and add an additional layer of
            indirection.
